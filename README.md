# Breast Screening Reporting

Welcome to the Breast Screening Reporting team's repository. This repo contains data pipelines and reports for the NHS Breast Screening programme. We use [Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/index.html) on Azure Databricks to ingest, clean and aggregate screening data through a **bronze → silver → gold** medallion architecture, deployed via [Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/index.html).

## Setup

This should be a frictionless installation process that works on various operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL) and handles all the dependencies.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html) | `brew install databricks` on macOS |
| [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) | For DLT code, tests and Git hooks |
| [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ≥ 3.82 | macOS default is older — `brew install make` |
| [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) | Version manager |

> [!NOTE]
> On macOS the default GNU make is too old. After `brew install make`, follow the Homebrew output to update your `$PATH`.

VS Code users: install the workspace-recommended extensions via the Command Palette → `@recommended` → **Install Workspace Recommended Extensions**.

## Quick start

```shell
# 1. Clone
git clone git@github.com:NHSDigital/dtos-breast-screening-reporting.git
cd dtos-breast-screening-reporting

# 2. Install toolchain & Python deps
make config

# 3. Configure Databricks CLI auth (one-time)
databricks auth login --profile dev

# enter workspace URL when prompted (see asset_bundles/databricks.yml)

# 4. Deploy your personal dev pipeline
cd asset_bundles
databricks bundle deploy -t dev

# 5. Run it
databricks bundle run -t dev sales_pipeline
```

Each developer gets isolated schemas (e.g. `bronze_<your_short_name>`) so you can deploy freely without affecting others.

```

## Development workflow

The day-to-day loop is:

1. Create a branch — see [Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Write or update DLT pipeline code in `asset_bundles/src/pipelines/`
3. Add resource definitions in `asset_bundles/resources/` if needed
4. Add unit tests to `asset_bundles/tests/unit`
5. Run test suite locally: `make test`
6. Deploy to your personal dev schemas: `databricks bundle deploy -t dev`
7. Run on Databricks: `databricks bundle run -t dev <pipeline_name>`
8. Open a PR — see [Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Testing

### Locally

```shell
# Local tests
make test

# Pre-commit hooks (secrets scan, linting, formatting)
make githooks-run
```

### On Databricks (dev)

```shell
cd asset_bundles
databricks bundle deploy -t dev
databricks bundle run -t dev <pipeline_name>
```

Review the pipeline run in the Databricks UI to verify data flows through bronze → silver → gold correctly.
